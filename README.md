# Project name: Techdemy 
# AltSchool Semester 1 Holiday Challenge

### What
This is one of the Holiday Challenge projects from semester 1

### Why
Practice makes perfect. To solidify my knowledge of React


### How
*   Build a simple dashboard for a tech school with React.js
*   CSS for styling


### SchoolStat - A simple dashboard for a tech school

#### Scenario

You have data about which instructors are taking the courses in a school, as well as data about which students are in the frontend, backend or cloud tracks. Your users need to see some basic stats about the school

#### Outcome: 

When the user opens your dashboard app, they see HTML tables showing the following statistics/summaries
* How many courses a given instructor is taking
* How many students are in each of the tracks (frontend, backend and cloud)
* How many students are male, female or other genders/orientation
* Minimum, maximum, and average age of students in the school

#### Advanced features (OPTIONAL- build any, some or all of the following if you feel up to it) 

* Make the tables sortable by (at least) the column holding the numbers. Indicate what columns are sortable (e.g with an icon or by adding the <> charectars in the column header e.t.c). When the user clicks on a sortable column header, sort the records in the table by that column (e.g switch the current sort order such that if the column was already sorted ASC, sort in DESC)
